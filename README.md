# Heart Disease Classification

This project is a Python implementation of various machine learning classifiers for predicting the presence of heart disease in patients based on their clinical data. The classifiers used in this project include Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

## Dataset

The project uses the "Heart Disease Classification Dataset" from Kaggle. The dataset contains various features such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. The target variable indicates the presence or absence of heart disease. CSV file of dataset is given in the repository.
